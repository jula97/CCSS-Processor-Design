# CCSS-Processor-Design
Custom multicore processor for matrix multiplication

# 1. Algorithms
Two single core algorithms are evaluated.
- **Normal**-(not used)Processing matirces in their original format.
- **Transposed**-A matrix is used as original. B matrix is transposed before processing.

Two multicore algorithms are evaluated.
- **Element**-(not used)An element of the final matrix is calculated by a core.
- **Block**-A block of one or many rows are calculated by a core.

# 2. Editable Documentation

# 3. Quartus Files
To test the processor locally, follow the following procedure.
```sh
$ git clone 
```
